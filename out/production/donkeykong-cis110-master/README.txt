This PROJECT runs a modified version of Donkey Kong arcade and the orignal game's code has been used as a tempelate by us. Unfair Donkey Kong is an online flash game but with added traps, tricks, and unexpected obstacles designed to frustrate and trick players. The game is known for its high level of difficulty and unfair gameplay, where it often surprises players with unexpected deaths and sudden changes in level design.

The game is often considered a "rage game" or a "troll game", as it is designed to intentionally provoke the player's frustration and challenge their patience. It has gained a reputation for being particularly difficult, even for experienced players of the Super Mario Bros. series.

However, it is important to note that the game's design and gameplay are not fair or balanced, which can lead to negative experiences and feelings of frustration for players. It is always recommended to play games that offer a fair and enjoyable experience for all players.



 All graphics were obtained from
    www.mariomayhem.com/downloads/sprites/donkey_kong_sprites.php and 
    www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/dk/sheet/45989/
    All audio was obtained from www.classicgaming.cc/classics/donkey-kong/sounds

    No other help was received. We did not receive any help outside of
    TA office hours. We did not collaborate with anyone, and we did not use any
    resources beyond the standard course materials and the graphics/audio.
